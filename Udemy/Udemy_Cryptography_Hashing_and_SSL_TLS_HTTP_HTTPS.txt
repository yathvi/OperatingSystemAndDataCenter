	18. What is frequency analysis?
		.
		For example in an english language text some letters are more frequent than others
		(E, A, O, I and T)

	45. Random and pseudo-random numbers
		.
		The main problem as far as one time pad is concerned is how to generate the random numbers
		Random number generation is the generation of sequence of numbers that cannot be reasonably
		predicted better than by a random chance.
		
		True Random Numbers
		-------------------
		If we measure some physical phenomenon then we end up with true random numbers
		For example:
			radioactive decay or atmospheric noise
			
				-> values have uniform distribution
				-> the values are independent of each other
				-> not so efficient: quite expensive to generate (measure) these numbers
				
		
		
		Pseudo-Random Numbers (fake randomness)
		---------------------------------------
		Instead of measuring some physical phenomenon, we use computers to generate random numbers
		PROBLEM: computers are deterministic !!!
			-> values have uniform distribution
			-> values are NOT independent of each other
			-> there are efficient algorithms to generate these pseudo-random values
		
	89. Integer factorization problem
		.
		If a fast approach is invented to factor large integers then internet sites would no longer be secure
