As mentioned in Section 1 (4. Course Setup) The VM is ~19GB in size.
Which you need to download to your local system (Laptop/Desktop/Some_Other_Device) and install.

================
Instead of that,
================
1.	I spinned up debian, ubuntu, fedora, centos and more (Operating System Docker Images) light weight docker images in my Mac system.
2.	You can also spinup (Operating System) in one of the cloud.

Understanding below

/sys
	Critical System Files
	
/etc
	Configurations
	
/bin
	Binaries
	
allow us to navigate any Linux environment and harness its full power.



Lets explore the key directories at the heart of the Linux file system.
	
First, the homes for executable binaries.
The layout of directories like /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin and their sbin counterparts follows a convention.


-----------------------------
Home for executable binaries
-----------------------------

1.	/bin contains core OS programs that must be accessible before /usr gets mounted at boot.
	For example, the command mount, ls, cd live here.

2.	/usr/bin is a primary home for binaries NOT part of the base OS itself.
	Most user programs live here.
		wget
		git
	
3.	/usr -> Unix System Resources, not user.

4.	/usr/local/bin holds executables installed by the admin, usually after building them from source.
	like firefox, vlc
	This keep local compiles (/usr/bin) separate to avoid overwriting system binaries (/bin).
	
5.	/sbin directory follows similar pattern that houses sysadmin utilities that require root access like iptables and sshd.
	iptables
	sshd
	sbin
	
6.	PATH Environment Variable
		
		/usr/bin
		/usr/local/bin
		/bin

		When the same binary exists in multiple directories, you can specify the default by reordering
		the directory precedence in the PATH variable.


----------------------
----------------------

7.	/lib contains shared library files essentail for /bin and /sbin binaries to function properly.
	These libraries need to be accessible early in the boot process before mounting /usr.
	They provide core functionality like C library routines (glibc) and compiler runtimes (libstdc++).
	
8.	/usr/lib holds libraries for /usr binaries that aren't critical for early system initialization.
	This includes UI libraries like GTK and QT as well as language runtimes like Python.
	you can also tweak the library search order via LD_LIBRARY_PATH

9.	/etc - the home of Linux configuration files.
	Text-based config files here control everything from networking to authentication services.


10.	For user data, /home stores documents, media and projects 

11.	While administrators have the exclusive /root folder.

12.	Fast-changing data like logs and caches live under /var.
	It is always buzzing with activity.
	
	We care about /var/log in particular to inspect 
	hardware events,
	security issues,
	performance problems
	
13.	/run contains volatile run-time info like 
	systemd details, 
	user sessions and 
	logging daemons.
	
	System services use /run for ongoing communication via sockets and lock files(mysql.sock)
	For example, mysql.sock might be crucial for database access.
	
14.	Finally, we come to the interconnected /proc and /sys virtual filesystems for Linux experts. (Virtual Filesystem)

	/proc opens communication channels to inspect overall OS state - we can check high-level metrics
	via cpuinfo, view filesystem mounts, and dive deeper with tools like lsof, strace and pmap.
		CPU Information
		Filesystem Mounts
	
	/sys exposes lower-level kernel and hardware objects, allowing granular monitoring and
	configuration of components like devices, modules, network stack via virtual files.
		-------------
		network stack
		-------------
		Socket Layer
		TCP Stack
		Netfilter
		Traffic Control (TC)
		Network Interface
		
15.	/proc (OS state) + /sys (Kernel and Hardware Objects) -> Combined, they provide complete system observability
	spanning high level metrics to low level component interactions.
	
	With /proc oriented towards process/runtime statistics and /sys providing component/hardware access,
	these inspection points are useful for performance tuning and forensic triage.
	
	
16.	You now have a roadmap to freely access critical Linux filesystem resources.
	Armed with this knowledge, you're ready to take full command.

 -------------------------------------------

		
		When you take a process and associate that process with these 3 mechanisms (Namespaces, Cgroup, Overlay Filesystems)
		What you get is a container.
		And once we understand that, we will see how container technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes do exactly that.
		That is, they leverage these same mechanisms behind the scenes to make it easier for us to create,
		manage and orchestrate containers at scale.
		So when we go to Docker and Kubernetes, we will make sure to look behind the scenes to understand how
		those technologies work and illustrate how they leverage these mechanisms behind the scenes.
		For example, when you control the amount of CPU or memory available to a Docker container,
		we will go behind the scenes and see how Cgroups are the mechanism that make it happen.
		
	3.	What is Containerization?	
		Containerization of Software is an approach to Isolating and Bundling an application with all
		the dependencies and only those dependencies together, including any Libraries, Data 
		and Configuration Files. 




66.	Recap and What's to Come
	
	NAMESPACES
		ISOLATION - ESSENCE OF CONTAINERIZATION
		
	OVERLAY FILESYSTEM
		SHARE RESOURCES BETWEEN CONTAINERS
		
	CGROUPS
		CONTROL RESOURCE ALLOCATION - CPU, MEMORY, NETWORK, ETC
		
	DOCKER
		MAKES CONTAINERIZATION EASIER
		IMAGE LAYERING - OVERLAY FS
		RESOURCE ALLOCATION - CGROUPS
		
	KUBERNETES
		IDEA OF A POD
		CREATE PODS, REPLICA SETS, DEPLOYMENTS
		CONTROL PLANE
		CONTROLLING POD RESOURCES - CGROUPS
		
	We started off with NAMESPACES, the key mechanism that enables isolation, which is the essence of containerization.
	We looked at what are the things that we can isolate.
	For example, the PID namespace helps us isolate a process or a set of processes
	so that only these processes can see and communicate with each other.
	And then we looked at the mount namespace that helps us isolate certain files and directories such that,
	These files and directories can be seen and accessed by only a certain set of processes.
	Again isolation.
	We looked at other kinds of namespaces such as the IPC namespace, the UTS namespace and the network namespace
	and what role each of these namespaces play. what resources they help isolate.
	
	
	And then we looked at OVERLAY FILESYSTEM.
	what it is? why it exist? how to create one and how it works.
	Specifically, we looked at what role the overlay file system plays in the world of containers.
	We saw how the overlay file system helps us avoid replicating modules so that they can be reused across containers. without replication.
	
	And then we looked at CGROUPS.
	The key mechanism that helps us control how much resource is available to a process.
	We looked at specific examples of how to control the amount of CPU and memory that is available to a process.
	
	
	And then we looked at DOCKER, the most popular container technology available today.
	We saw how docker makes containerization easier.
	And then we took an in-depth look at how image layering works, what it is, and more importantly.
	What is the key mechanism that makes image layering possible. that is overlay file system.
	And we also looked at how we can control the amount of resource available to a container such as a CPU or memory.
	And again, we tied this back to C Groups.
	That is C Groups is the mechanism behind the scenes that makes this resource allocation possible.
	
	
	And then we looked at KUBERNETES.
	We started off with the idea of a pod. we saw what it is, why it exist, and how to create one by just using namespaces
	or more specifically, by using nested namespaces.
	We saw how we can create pods from the command line. And using YAML files.
	We also looked at other Kubernetes resources, such as replica sets and deployments.
	We looked at what role they play, why they exist, and how we can create one using the kubectl command line tool.
	We also looked at what Kubernetes control plane is, what the key components of a Kubernetes control plane are,
	and what role each of these components play.
	And finally, we looked at how we can control the amount of resources available to a pod, such as a CPU or Memory.
	
	Again, we type this back to C groups, that is C groups is the mechanism behind the scenes that makes this resource allocation possible.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	


7. Namespaces - Understanding the Solution

	When we say Namespaces, we could refer to two things
		First, it could mean it could refer to the kernel feature that helps provide this isolation
		between sets of processes.
		
		or it could refer to a particular instance of namespace.
		In this case, the two tags here are two different namespaces.

54. The Idea of a Pod

A pod in Kubernetes is the most basic object that we can create, deploy and manage.
In Docker, the basic object is container.


A Kubernetes pod is a logical entity that groups related containers together so that when you create a pod,
your'e creating all the related containers together.

And the lifecycle of the pod is directly connected to the lifecycle of all these containers.

But there are many scenarios where something like this is needed.
That is, you need to be able to group together a bunch of related containers.
So the lifecycle of these containers are tied together.
They are running on the same machine.
They are running in an isolated environment in certain ways, like in their own namespace,
having their own files and directories, but sharing certain resources such as IP address space, the set of ports
and IPC mechanisms such as the message queue.
Now this should give you a hint as to how a pod is related to namespace.


A POD JUST LIKE A CONTAINER, IS JUST ANOTHER NAMESPACE AT ITS CORE, 
AND THE CONATINERS WITHIN A POD ARE ESSENTIALLY NESTED NAMESPACES WITHIN THE POD.

/ # mount --help
BusyBox v1.36.1 (2023-11-07 18:53:09 UTC) multi-call binary.

Usage: mount [OPTIONS] [-o OPT] DEVICE NODE

Mount a filesystem. Filesystem autodetection requires /proc.

	-a		Mount all filesystems in fstab
	-f		Dry run
	-i		Don't run mount helper
	-v		Verbose
	-r		Read-only mount
	-t FSTYPE[,...]	Filesystem type(s)
	-O OPT		Mount only filesystems with option OPT (-a only)
-o OPT:
	loop		Ignored (loop devices are autodetected)
	[a]sync		Writes are [a]synchronous
	[no]atime	Disable/enable updates to inode access times
	[no]diratime	Disable/enable atime updates to directories
	[no]relatime	Disable/enable atime updates relative to modification time
	[no]dev		(Dis)allow use of special device files
	[no]exec	(Dis)allow use of executable files
	[no]suid	(Dis)allow set-user-id-root programs
	[r]shared	Convert [recursively] to a shared subtree
	[r]slave	Convert [recursively] to a slave subtree
	[r]private	Convert [recursively] to a private subtree
	[un]bindable	Make mount point [un]able to be bind mounted
	[r]bind		Bind a file or directory [recursively] to another location
	move		Relocate an existing mount point
	remount		Remount a mounted filesystem, changing flags
	ro		Same as -r

There are filesystem-specific -o flags.

[root@e0ebee382b9e /]# mount --help

Usage:
 mount [-lhV]
 mount -a [options]
 mount [options] [--source] <source> | [--target] <directory>
 mount [options] <source> <directory>
 mount <operation> <mountpoint> [<target>]

Mount a filesystem.

Options:
 -a, --all               mount all filesystems mentioned in fstab
 -c, --no-canonicalize   don't canonicalize paths
 -f, --fake              dry run; skip the mount(2) syscall
 -F, --fork              fork off for each device (use with -a)
 -T, --fstab <path>      alternative file to /etc/fstab
 -i, --internal-only     don't call the mount.<type> helpers
 -l, --show-labels       show also filesystem labels
 -n, --no-mtab           don't write to /etc/mtab
 -o, --options <list>    comma-separated list of mount options
 -O, --test-opts <list>  limit the set of filesystems (use with -a)
 -r, --read-only         mount the filesystem read-only (same as -o ro)
 -t, --types <list>      limit the set of filesystem types
     --source <src>      explicitly specifies source (path, label, uuid)
     --target <target>   explicitly specifies mountpoint
 -v, --verbose           say what is being done
 -w, --rw, --read-write  mount the filesystem read-write (default)

 -h, --help              display this help
 -V, --version           display version

Source:
 -L, --label <label>     synonym for LABEL=<label>
 -U, --uuid <uuid>       synonym for UUID=<uuid>
 LABEL=<label>           specifies device by filesystem label
 UUID=<uuid>             specifies device by filesystem UUID
 PARTLABEL=<label>       specifies device by partition label
 PARTUUID=<uuid>         specifies device by partition UUID
 <device>                specifies device by path
 <directory>             mountpoint for bind mounts (see --bind/rbind)
 <file>                  regular file for loopdev setup

Operations:
 -B, --bind              mount a subtree somewhere else (same as -o bind)
 -M, --move              move a subtree to some other place
 -R, --rbind             mount a subtree and all submounts somewhere else
 --make-shared           mark a subtree as shared
 --make-slave            mark a subtree as slave
 --make-private          mark a subtree as private
 --make-unbindable       mark a subtree as unbindable
 --make-rshared          recursively mark a whole subtree as shared
 --make-rslave           recursively mark a whole subtree as slave
 --make-rprivate         recursively mark a whole subtree as private
 --make-runbindable      recursively mark a whole subtree as unbindable
